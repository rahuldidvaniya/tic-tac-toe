# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players can play against each other. The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on clear game logic and an intuitive user interface.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode:** The game supports two players, with one player using "X" and the other "O".
- **Turn-Based Gameplay:** Players take turns to place their tokens on the 3x3 grid.
- **Win Detection:** The game detects when a player has won and highlights the winning combination.
- **Draw Detection:** The game identifies if the board is full without a winner, resulting in a draw.
- **Reset Functionality:** A reset button allows players to clear the board and start a new game.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** The first player to click on any cell will automatically be assigned "X".
2. **Take Turns:** Players alternate turns by clicking on an empty cell. The second player is assigned "O".
3. **Winning:** The game will declare a winner if a player manages to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
4. **Draw:** If all cells are filled without a winner, the game will declare a draw.
5. **Reset:** Click the "Reset" button to start a new round.
